# Copy Command

## How it works?
This command copies a file by **reading it in small chunks** (4 KB at a time) and writing each chunk to a new file. If you imagine a **16 KB file**, it is split into **four 4 KB blocks**, which are read and written one by one until the entire file is copied.

    A(Start) --> B(Open source file);
    B -->|Success| C(Open destination file);
    B -->|Failure| X(Print error and exit);
    
    C -->|Success| D{Read up to 4096 bytes};
    C -->|Failure| Y(Print error, close source file, exit);
    
    D -->|Read > 0| E{Bytes left to write?};
    D -->|Read failed| Z(Print error, close files, exit);
    
    E -->|Yes| F(Write bytes to destination);
    E -->|No| D;
    
    F -->|Success| E;
    F -->|Failure| W(Print error, close files, exit);
    
    D -->|Read == 0| G(Close source file);
    G --> H(Close destination file);
    H --> I(End);

    X -->|Exit| X1[Stop];
    Y -->|Exit| Y1[Stop];
    Z -->|Exit| Z1[Stop];
    W -->|Exit| W1[Stop];

## üöÄ How to Run
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Compile the program

**For C:**
```sh
gcc copy.c -o copy
```
**For Rust:**
```sh
cd copy
cargo build --release
mv target/release/copy .
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the command
```sh
./copy source.txt destination.txt
```

Replace `source.txt` with the file you want to copy and `destination.txt` with the output file.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Option: Move the binary to a system path
Once the binary is built, move it to a directory that is included in your system's `$PATH`, such as `/usr/local/bin`:
```sh
sudo mv copy /usr/local/bin/
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/copy
```
üìå **Explanation:**

- `mv copy /usr/local/bin/` ‚Üí Moves the binary to a globally accessible location.
- `chmod +x /usr/local/bin/copy` ‚Üí Ensures it's executable.
Now you can run the command from any directory.
```sh
copy file1.txt file2.txt
```

## üõ† Error Handling
- If the source file **doesn‚Äôt exist**, the program exits with an error.
- If there‚Äôs an issue **writing to the destination file**, it also exits with an error.
- All files are **closed properly** after copying to avoid resource leaks.

## üìå Notes
- Uses a **4 KB buffer size** for efficiency.
- Works on **Unix-based systems** (Linux/macOS).
